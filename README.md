## Health Care Sector and Social Media: Advantages and Disadvantages

## INTRODUCTION 


Social media is an online tool that is becoming quite popular these days because of its user-friendly features. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and more are giving people a chance to connect with each other across distances. In other words, the whole world is at our fingertips all thanks to social media. In every area of sectors whether its private or public use it for their own purposes or interest.
There are also social media platforms for the healthcare industry like social networking platforms, blogs, microblogs, wikis, media-sharing sites, and virtual reality and gaming environments. [1]
All these lucrative things also come with some cons. It's so powerful and with such a massive reach cannot be all good. Like how there are always two sides to a coin, the same goes for social media.

* PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

Social media provides Health care professionals with tools to share information, to debate health care policy and practice issues, to promote health behaviors, to engage with the public, and to educate and interact with patients, caregivers, students, and colleagues.[2]
HCPs can take advantage of social media to potentially improve health outcomes, develop a professional network, increase personal awareness of news and discoveries, motivate patients, and provide health information to the community.[3]
Physicians most often join online communities where they can read news updates, listen to experts' opinions, research medical developments, consult colleagues regarding patient issues, and network.[4]





In a survey it was found that more than 90% of physicians use some form of social media for personal activities, whereas only 65% use these sites for professional reasons conducted by the social media site QuantiaMD on 4,000 physicians.[5,6]

* USES OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN HEALTH CARE


The most visited sites for social media are those where physicians can participate in online communities, listen to experts, and network and communicate with colleagues regarding patient issues.[7]The use of social media sites by pharmacists also frequently focuses on communication or discussion with colleagues.[8]

Social media can also be utilized to connect HCPs with countries specialists in more medically advanced locations.[9] For example, surgical procedures can be streamed live via the Internet and questions can be asked via video call in real time.[10] Thus, social media provides a new communication channel for Health care providers to share and exchange medical information in ways and at a pace that was never before possible because of technological advancement.[11]
Although there is unfavorable support among health care professionals to use social media for direct contact with patient care, this practice is slowly being accepted by clinicians and health care facilities.[12,13] For example, Georgia Health Sciences University has provided patients with access to a platform called WebView, which allows the patients to contact their doctors to ask questions or to request prescription refills.[14] Doctors can nowadays easily give consultations through social media and they are increasing their reach with the patient all over the globe.

* Disadvantages of Social media

The major drawback of health information found on social media and other online sources is a lack of quality and authenticity.[15]The content writers on these sites sometimes do not have knowledge or education on that field, but for the sake of money they write on the hot current topics to gain an audience to their pages. The risk associated with the use of social media is the posting of unprofessional content that can reflect unfavorably on HCPs, students, and affiliated institutions.
Concerns regarding the use of social media by HCPs also result in breaching of patient confidentiality. Social media is a huge distraction for students or Doctors who manage time poorly and leads to low concentration during work also. It also encourages amateur advice and self-diagnosis of health problems, which sometimes leads to sometimes major repercussions for the individual.This is no different in the social media realm, as social media platforms are getting attacked every single day. Whether or not each attack is successful is one thing, but users run the risk of potentially having their private information stolen from an unwanted source.


* Advantages of Social media

With social media, more users can become more informed about topics they are interested in, and find ways to participate in those activities they are passionate about.The main advantages of using social media in healthcare, such as increasing interactions among patients and doctors are the key in today's digital era to keep updated with the false information. As the medical sciences is expanding day by day through the collaborations of different expert working from across the globe on same projects is the key outcome of social media.
Due to social platforms or the ease of the Internet, sharing and tailoring information becomes too smooth for an HCP.These Platforms are increasing accessibility to health information and providing emotional and social support among the patient as well. The professionals enhance themselves with the new research that is carried out and published on the Internet. 
It also helps in regulating the government policies on larger level and contributing to public health studies.
